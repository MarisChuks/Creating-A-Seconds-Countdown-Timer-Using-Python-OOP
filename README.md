# Countdown Timer
This project implements a CountdownTimer class in Python, allowing users to start a countdown from a specified number of seconds.

## Description
The CountdownTimer class is designed to provide a simple and intuitive way to create countdown timers in Python. It includes the following features:

#### Initialization: The CountdownTimer class is initialized with a specified number of seconds for the countdown.
Start Countdown: Use the start_countdown method to begin the countdown timer.
#### User Input Handling: The get_user_input function ensures that the user provides a valid integer input for the countdown timer.

### Getting Started
#### Import CountdownTimer: Import the CountdownTimer class from the countdown_timer.py file.
#### Create Timer Instance: Create an instance of CountdownTimer with the desired number of seconds.
#### Start Countdown: Call the start_countdown method to begin the countdown.
#When you run this script, it will prompt you to enter the number of seconds for the countdown, and then it will start the countdown. During the countdown, the script will print the time remaining every second.
